## How to Play
- Traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game
- First to 5 wins the game!
- Clicking on an image will make your selection and tell you what the A.I. chose.
- You will see the result of the round and a tracker that keeps count until the player or A.I. reaches 5 wins.
- Once five wins have been reached pressing any of the three selection images will reset the counter to 0 and play the first round of a new game.

## About this Project

A fun little project I am particularly fond of as this was my first JavaScript program built completely from scratch. 

I learnt and implemented:
- Creating functions
- If statements
- Manipulating the DOM
- Accepting user input
- Flexbox
